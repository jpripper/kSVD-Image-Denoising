An C++ implementation of Image Resconstruction using Dictionary Learning KSV [1]. 

In this implemenation, greedy matching pursuit algorithm is used for finding sparse coding. 

Dataset: 
 We used face dataset Faces94 http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/mv/allfaces/faces94.html for
 the experiments. We have randomly selected 10 images for training and 1 other image for testing.
 All color images are converted to gray-scale image. 500 random patches are chosen for training. 

Required libraries: 


Tested Enviroment 


Compile: 



Run:
